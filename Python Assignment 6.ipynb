    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions helps in reducing repetition and unwanted effort in rewriting a block of code \n",
    "thus making the entire code smaller and more efficient just by calling function and executing\n",
    "it at will to get the desired output. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function is called, it is only then the code within a function is executed and not when \n",
    "it's specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, its the \"def\" statement (shortform for define) which is used to create a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, a function or defining a function is merely defining the ways that function\n",
    "will execute upon calling. Whereas a function call is a statement which takes in argument/arguments\n",
    "and executes the block of code within that function. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Python program, there is only one single global scope and one local scope within a defined\n",
    "function. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Local variables dont exist beyond function return. Once a function completes its execution\n",
    "it flushes out all the storage for local variables so they dont exist after that. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "The return statement is used within a function to fetch the output of executing a certain \n",
    "block of code. This return statement helps in getting an output in the desired format which \n",
    "can be reused unlike print statement which returns a NoneType. \n",
    "\n",
    "No, return cannot be used for an expression. It can be used only within a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that \n",
    "function?\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no return statement within a function, then the return value would be None. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use \"global\" prefix before a function variable to refer a global variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "NoneType is the data type of None. \n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon execution it will throw up ModuleNotFoundError, and that means there is no library or \n",
    "a module that exists by this name which can be imported. \n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "If i am using Jupyter Notebook, I can stop the kernel. Or I can restart the kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "The try clause and except clause is part of exception handling which helps Python in handling \n",
    "exceptions while executing a code. \n",
    "So, the try clause encloses a code block where an exception is expected. \n",
    "And except clause is used to handle that exception when it happens and execute the code below it. \n"
