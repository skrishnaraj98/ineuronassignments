    "1. What are escape characters, and how do you use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Escape characters are special characters which are used within a string to represent some characters which cannot be represented\n",
    "using the regular characters or methods. For example, using regular characters and methods we cannot represent tabs, backslash,\n",
    "newline characters, and quotes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most commonly used escape characters are: \n",
    "    1. \"\\n\"-new line character\n",
    "    2. \"\\t\"-tab charactor \n",
    "    3. \"\\\\\"-Backslash character\n",
    "    \n",
    "For example: \n",
    "    print(\"Hello\\nWorld\")  - Output= Hello\n",
    "                                     World\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(\"Hello\\tWorld\")  - Output= Hello\tWorld\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\\\\World\")  - Output= Hello\\World\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. What do the escape characters n and t stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\\n\" - newline character helps strings in representing string in new line from where its used after that. \n",
    "\"\\t\" - tab character helps string in displaying a tab between two sections of a string. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the way to include backslash characters in a string?\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert a backlash within a string we can use \"\\\\\" backlash character within the string. \n",
    "For example: \n",
    "    print(\"Hello\\\\World\")      Output = Hello\\World\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The string \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a correct value. Why isn't the single quote character in the word Howl's not \n",
    " escaped a problem?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here's it's not a problem because, the string started with double quotes and so string will only look for the another double \n",
    "quotes to consider an end of the string. If the string would have started in single quotes then it would have thrown an Error. \n",
    "Since it is within 2 double quotes that's why it has escaped the problem. \n",
    "Same is the case with a single double quote within two single quotes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: print('How you\"re doing?')     Output= How you\"re doing?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. How do you write a string of newlines if you don't want to use the n character?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use triple quotes method, and using that we can create any number of new lines. \n",
    "For example: \n",
    "    print(\"\"\"How\n",
    "you're \n",
    "doing?\"\"\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Output =\n",
    "    How\n",
    "    you're \n",
    "    doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are the values of the given expressions?\n",
    "'Hello, world!'[1]    = \"e\"\n",
    "'Hello, world!'[0:5]  = \"Hello\"\"\n",
    "'Hello, world!'[:5]   = \"Hello\"\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are the values of the following expressions?\n",
    "'Hello'.upper()            = 'HELLO'\n",
    "'Hello'.upper().isupper()  = True\n",
    "'Hello'.upper().lower()    = 'hello'\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the methods for right-justifying, left-justifying, and centering a string?\n",
    "\n",
