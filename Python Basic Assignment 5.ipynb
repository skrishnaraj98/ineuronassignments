    "Empty dictionary looks like this {}. For example: \n",

    "3. What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries and lists are both mutable ordered sequences. But the major difference between them is how they store values \n",
    "within them. Dictionaries store elements in a key-and-value pair while lists directly stores them. Dictionaries use curly \n",
    "brackets while lists use square brackets. \n",

    "4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?\n",

    "It will return a KeyError. Since there is no key with the name \"foo\" within the dictionary named spam. \n",

    "a False as the output as the \"spam\" dictionary do not have \"cat\" as a key. Coming to the difference, the first expression will\n",
    "directly check whether \"cat\" is a key within the dictionary and the 2nd dictionary expression will see whether \"cat\" is within\n",
    "a list containing all the keys of the \"spam\" dictionary. Effectively both expressions are checking the same thing in their \n",
    "different ways. \n",

    "6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?\n",

    "if 'color' not in spam:\n",
