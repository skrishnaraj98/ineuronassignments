    "Append() methods attach an element at the last of the list. And the insert() method takes in two \n",

    "\n",
    "The list values and string values are not identical but they have similarities on a broader scale. \n",
    "Like both list and string values can be concatenated, sliced and indexed, and both of them can be iterated and many others. \n",

    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are mutable sequence of elements which are held within 2 square brackets. Whereas Tuple is an\n",

    "\n",
    "I am not sure what you mean by this question. Anyway, I guess you are asking about the reference \n",

    "\n",
    "Copy method will do a shallow copy of the original sequence whereas deepcopy will do a replica kind of deep copying to make a duplicate sequence which looks excatly like the original one. Both methods will copy even the nested ones, but upon changing an element within the nested part of the sequence, the copy method will reflect those changes whereas deepcopy will still show the original unchanged sequence. \n",
