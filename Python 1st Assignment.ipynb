    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "*       : Expression\n",
    "'hello' : Value\n",
    "-87.8   : Value\n",
    "-       : Expression\n",
    "/       : Expression\n",
    "6       : Value\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "String is a combination of characters and variable is an entity to which we can assign or store any value so that we can call it whenever there is a need without the need to write again. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "String - A combination of characters. \n",
    "Integer - Number basically upon which we can perform mathematical operations. \n",
    "Float - Numbers with a decimal point. This allows us to precisely take in input and return outputs downto the exact measure. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are basically any combination between a value, variable, operands, and functions which has to be computed get a result. It is a way of expressing a result that we desire. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "spam = 10 is a statement and not an expression, as it tells the programming language to allocate memory for the variable \"spam\". Likewise, a statement can be defined as something which is telling directly to the programming language which may or may not return an output, whereas expressions is something which is as we discussed earlier our way of expressing a desired outcome in a language for a programming language to compute and return the output. So here \"10\" can be considered as the expression which is associated with a variable \"spam\" within an entire statement (spam = 10). \n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable \"bacon\" will still have the same value 22. (bacon=22).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam' : 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3          : 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's because 100 is by default a integer datatype and that's the reason you cannot make a datatype as a variable. And also, the correct form of equation used in programming languages must have a variable in the left side and its value on the right hands side. So if you keep 100 in the left hand side and some value in the right hand side, this will lead to an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Typecasting is used to convert a particular value from one data type to another. So in this case let's consider an example: \n",
    "\n",
    "a=10\n",
    "type(a) = int\n",
    "\n",
    "now to convert this integer data type to floating-point number we will use: \n",
    "float(a) : will convert the output 10 to 10.0. \n",
    "\n",
    "then to convert this float to string we will use: \n",
    "str(a) : this will convert the output 10 to \"10\". \n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you can cannot concantenate a string data type with an integer. So to fix this, we have to remove the integer or both the strings. There are two possible outcomes when we perform either of them: \n",
    "\n",
    "Output 1: 'I have eaten burritos'\n",
    "Output 2: 99\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
